DOCUMENTATION

The selected rows and columns of a 2n x 2n matrix of integers can be reversed in a sequence 
to generate a new matrix which has the maximum sum of n x n first quadrant submatrix out of all 
possible new 2n x 2n matrices generated by reversing rows and/or columns.

This program finds the matrix with largest sum on first quadrant.

Solution methodology
-----------------------
If a row or a column is reversed, the elements are exchanged by the elements present at their
mirror location. For example if we reverse a 4 x 1 column, the element at location 0 is replaced
by element at location 3. Location 3 is the mirror position of location 0. The element at 
location 1 is replaced by the element at location 2 by the same logic. The same understanding
also applies to a 1 x 4 row. In general, if we reverse a 2n x 1 column or 1 x 2n row, the 
element at location i is relplaced by the element at its mirror location 2n-1-i.

In this problem, we have a 2n x 2n matrix which has 2n 2n x 1 rows and 2n 2n x 1 columns.
So each element in this matrix has three mirror positions: one reflection on corresponding
location on its symmetric row, one reflection on corresponsing location on its symmetric column
and one reflection on the intersection of the symmetric row and column. An example to visualize
this is shown below for a 8 x 8 matrix, such that m = 2n = 8 and n = 4.

The elements of this matrix are shown by * and the considered element whose mirror locations
are to be identified is shown by #. We selected the element at location 1,2 (second row, third
column). Its mirror on the symmetric row is on seventh row, on the symmetric column is on fifth
column and intersection of these two rows and columns. The intersection too is considered to be 
a mirror location because the mirror locations too mirror their locations. All the mirror locations
are in different quadrants, one in each. We can show the quadrants as:

Lets say 2n = m.
For an element on location [i][j] has mirror locations at [i][m-1-j], [m-1-i][m-1-j] and [m-1-i][j].
This arrangement is extracted clockwise from above diagram.

Discussed earlier, as we reverse a row or column, the elements get exchanged by the elements at
their mirror locations. As the problem allows us to collect maximum elements in the first quadrant
to generate maximum sum by reversing rows or columns, we now know that we will be bringing the
element at mirror location of that row or column. This means if we pick an element in the first
quadrant of matrix, we will analyze elements at its mirror locations and will carry our a reversing 
operation if the elements on mirror locations in greater than the picked up element.

So, we will pick up each element in the first quadrant and check if any mirror element is greater
than this element. If found greater, we will reverse the row if the mirror location is on the same
row, and reverse the column if mirror location is on a different row. If the picked up element has 
highest value among the elements on its mirror location, we will not carry any reverse operation
and move to another element in the first quadrant.

To prevent any outer (low indexed) element in first quadrant to influence the reverse operation of 
inner (high indexed) elements, we will start from inner element ([n-1][n-1]) and then move out columnwise.

We initiate indices on lines 61 and 62. This is the innermost element in forst quadrant. After analyzing
this element and moving out columnwise, till all indices are consumed (line 63) after which we stop 
reversing operations, we do the following:

on line 64, we check which of the selected elements and elements on its mirror positions is largest.
If the element itself is largest (checked on line 66) , we dont do anything and add this number to maxSum 
which was initiated to be zero.

If any other number is highest, we carry out a reverse operation. Following our clockwise listing of the mirror 
locations, if the element on same row is highest (checked on line 67), we reverse the row on line 68. If the
element is on a different row (checked on line 70), we reverse the column.

We move out columnwise to analyze elements in first quadrant, on lines 78 - 81.
