The situation is that there are n chasers, and someone is observing them. At a given point of observation, the any chaser can be
characterized by their position and speed at that point of observation. The speed is assumed to be constant and position varies with
every step the chaser runs. 

Problem is to determine that from a given observation point in time, at which each chaser is at a given position and running 
with a given speed, will all the chasers meet at some time in future at the same location? Means, after some time, will they be
able to manage to gather at same position if they keep running with their corresponding speeds?

This is solved using linear algebra. 
Suppose there are two chasers at t = 0, at positions x_1 and x_2, and running with speeds v_1 and v_2 respectively.
If they have to meet at some point, say after time t_f, and they meet at position t_f, then
total distance run by chaser 1 before meeting chaser 2 is x_f-x_1 and 
total distance run by chaser 2 before meeting chaser 1 is x_f-x_2.

Because they meet at time t_f, we know that
(x_f-x_1) = v_1*t
(x_f-x_2) = v_2*t

This is a set of two equations in two unknowns: x_f and t_f.
If x_f > 0 and t_f > 0, then we conclude that the chasers meet, otherwise they dont meet.

For two chasers, it can be very easily solved. But for more number of chasers, we get more equations
